# (ARCHIVED) C++ Game Engine with PBR
My senior project for my BS in Game Design and Development at Rochester Institute of Technology.

* Physically based material rendering
* Rudimentary 3d physics
* Particles
* Terrain
* Entity component game object model
* Hierarchical scene tree

Project pulled from my archive no git history

I'm able to build and run it on windows 10 and have included an executable in case you can't.
